# ICI_SDKbodytemp
Quick set of functions and example of grabbing body and FPA temperature from ICI camera radiometric images. You need the ICI SDK, which is proprietary and not available in this repository for that reason. Add the file (ICI.dll) in dll(dll).

An example of:
1) wrapping python around the SDK .dll functions (c++) can be found in ICIfunctions.py
2) applying the ICIfunctions.py is found in metaFromImage.py
